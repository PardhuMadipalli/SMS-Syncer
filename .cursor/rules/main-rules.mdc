## Main rules

- Always read the main [README.md](mdc:README.md) file to understand the project goal and what has been implemented so far.
- Always update the main [README.md](mdc:README.md) file to reflect any changes made to the project.
- Do not use or create any sub-folder README files - always use the main [README.md](mdc:README.md) at the project root.
- When making changes, ensure the main [README.md](mdc:README.md) is updated with new features, implementation details, or any relevant project information.
