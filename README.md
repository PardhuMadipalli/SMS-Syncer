# SMS syncer

## Goal
The goal is to build an android app that can send SMS messages after filtering them to ntfy.sh topic.

## Features
1. Send SMS messages to ntfy.sh topic
2. âœ… **Customizable SMS Filtering**: Advanced filtering system with customizable rules for important senders, keywords, and spam detection. Users can add/remove filter criteria and reset to defaults.
3. âœ… **SMS Permission Management**: The app automatically checks for SMS read permissions and requests them if not present. Users can grant permissions through the app interface.
4. âœ… **Contact Name Resolution**: Automatically displays contact names instead of phone numbers in notifications when contacts permission is granted. Falls back to phone numbers if permission is denied.
5. âœ… **Secure Topic Configuration**: Users can configure their ntfy.sh topic name securely with confirmation dialog. The topic is stored using Android's EncryptedSharedPreferences.
6. âœ… **Topic Display**: The app shows a masked version of the configured topic (first 2 and last 2 characters visible).
7. âœ… **Material Design 3 UI**: Modern, beautiful interface following Google's latest design guidelines with card-based layout, professional icons, and enhanced user experience.

## Security & Google Play Protect Compliance

### Security Measures Implemented
- **HTTPS Only**: All network communication uses secure HTTPS connections
- **Code Obfuscation**: Release builds use ProGuard for code protection
- **Network Security**: Network security configuration prevents insecure connections
- **Input Sanitization**: All data is sanitized before transmission
- **No Sensitive Logging**: SMS content is not logged or exposed in error messages
- **Permission Validation**: Proper permission checking and user consent
- **Secure Permissions**: Uses `BROADCAST_SMS` permission for receiver protection
- **Selective Encryption**: Topic names (potentially identifying) use EncryptedSharedPreferences with AES256 encryption, filter settings use standard storage
- **Topic Masking**: Topic names are displayed with only first 2 and last 2 characters visible for privacy

### Privacy Protection
- **Local Processing**: All SMS filtering and contact resolution happens locally on your device
- **No Data Storage**: SMS messages and contact information are not stored locally or on servers
- **Personal Topic**: Messages are sent only to your personal ntfy.sh topic
- **No Third-Party Access**: We do not have access to your ntfy.sh topic or messages
- **Contact Privacy**: Contact names are only used for display purposes and are not stored or transmitted

### SMS Filtering
The app intelligently filters SMS messages to forward only important ones:
- **Important senders**: Banks, delivery services, ride-sharing apps
- **Important keywords**: OTP, urgent, delivery, payment, etc.
- **Numeric codes**: OTP and verification codes
- **Spam filtering**: Excludes promotional messages
- **Customizable rules**: Users can modify all filter criteria through an intuitive settings interface
- **Forward all option**: Toggle to ignore all filters and forward every SMS message
- **Reset to defaults**: Easy restoration of original filter settings

### Technical Implementation
- Uses Android's BroadcastReceiver to listen for incoming SMS

## macOS Notification System

The project includes shell scripts for receiving SMS notifications on macOS:

### Setup
1. **Create Configuration File**: Create `/Users/Shared/SMS_Syncer_Listener/config.json` with your ntfy.sh topic:
   ```bash
   echo '{"topic_name":"your_topic_name"}' > /Users/Shared/SMS_Syncer_Listener/config.json
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have the required tools:
   ```bash
   brew install jq  # For JSON parsing
   ```

3. **Make Scripts Executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x manage_ntfy.sh
   chmod +x ntfy_notifier.sh
   ```

### Usage
- **Start/Stop/Restart**: `./manage_ntfy.sh [start|stop|restart]`
- **Check Status**: `./manage_ntfy.sh status`
- **View Logs**: `./manage_ntfy.sh logs`
- **Default Action**: Running `./manage_ntfy.sh` without arguments will restart the notifier

### Features
- **Configuration-Based**: Topic name is read from config file, not hardcoded in scripts
- **Automatic Reconnection**: Handles network disconnections gracefully
- **Log Management**: Automatic log rotation to prevent disk space issues
- **Singleton Protection**: Prevents multiple instances from running
- **System Notifications**: Displays SMS messages as native macOS notifications

## Installation
The app is designed to pass Google Play Protect scans and follows Android security best practices. Users may need to:
1. Grant SMS permissions when prompted
2. Trust the app in Google Play Protect settings if needed
3. Ensure the app has network access for ntfy.sh communication
